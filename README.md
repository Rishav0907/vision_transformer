# Vision Transformer using PyTorch

## Overview
This project implements a Vision Transformer (ViT) model using PyTorch for image classification tasks. The model is designed to work with the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Untitled4.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and test the Vision Transformer model.

## Model Architecture
The Vision Transformer consists of the following components:
- **Multi-Headed Self-Attention**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input image.
- **Encoder Blocks**: Stacks of multi-headed self-attention and feed-forward neural networks.
- **Positional Encoding**: Adds information about the position of patches in the input image.
- **Classification MLP**: A multi-layer perceptron for classifying the output.

## Training
The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset with various configurations, including different data sizes and patch sizes. The training process includes:
- Data augmentation and normalization.
- Adam optimizer for weight updates.
- Cross-entropy loss for classification.

## Testing
After training, the model is evaluated on the test dataset. The accuracy and loss are reported for each test run.

## Results
The model's performance can be visualized through training loss plots and attention maps for test images. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Vision Transformer architecture for image classification tasks.
